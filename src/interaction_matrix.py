def Sherrington_Kirkpatrick_1D(system_size:int):
    """
    Generate a symmetric interaction matrix for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model 
    in one dimension by sampling from a normal distribution.

    This function creates a square matrix of shape (system_size, system_size) 
    where the strictly upper triangular entries (excluding the diagonal) are 
    independently sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
    The lower triangular part is implicitly zero (or can be assumed to be symmetric if needed).

    Parameters:
        system_size (int): The number of spins (or nodes) in the system. 
                           This determines the dimensions of the matrix.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: A 2D NumPy array of shape (system_size, system_size) with the upper
                       triangular part filled with normally distributed random values and 
                       zeros elsewhere.
                       
    Example:
        >>> np.random.seed(0)
        >>> matrix = Sherrington_Kirkpatrick_1D(4)
        >>> print(matrix)
        [[ 0.          1.76405235  0.40015721  0.97873798]

def Fully_connected_1D(system_size:int):
    """
    Create a fully connected interaction matrix in one dimension.

    This function returns a matrix of shape (system_size, system_size) 
    where the strictly upper triangular entries (excluding the diagonal) 
    are set to 1, indicating a fully connected network in one direction (i.e., 
    connections exist from each node to every other node with a higher index).
    The lower triangular entries (including the diagonal) remain zero.

    Parameters:
        system_size (int): The number of nodes in the system. 
                           Determines the dimensions of the output matrix.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: A 2D NumPy array of shape (system_size, system_size) with the 
                       strictly upper triangular entries set to 1 and zeros elsewhere.
